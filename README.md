While Learning React and Redux, I gained a deep understanding of the core concepts of these powerful libraries, mastering state management, component lifecycles, hooks and much more. Throughout the learning, I have engaged in hands-on learning by creating 12 diverse mini projects, each designed to reinforce different concepts. These projects range from simple applications showcasing fundamental React principles to more complex solutions that integrated Redux for effective state management.
